## Error: Missing Scraped Elements (Solscan)

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Context:** Web scraping data specifically from Solscan within the main scraping logic.
**Problem:** The scraping logic for Solscan sometimes fails to find expected HTML elements or data points. This might be due to website structure changes, dynamic loading issues, or selectors becoming invalid. This leads to incomplete data being passed to later stages (e.g., `df_manager`), potentially causing errors or incorrect results. Initially, error handling for missing elements might have been insufficient.
**Solution:**

1.  Implement more robust checks within the Solscan scraper to verify element presence _before_ attempting to extract data (e.g., using `try-except` blocks around element finding, checking if found elements are `None`).
2.  Add explicit logging for when expected elements are not found on Solscan.
3.  Consider using more resilient selectors (e.g., based on stable attributes if available) or adding retry logic with delays for dynamic content.
4.  Ensure downstream components (like `df_manager`) have checks for potentially `None` or missing data fields originating from Solscan.

## Error: Data Loss Between Queues (Pipeline Sequence)

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Context:** Multi-stage data processing pipeline using queues to pass data between different scraper/processor threads.
**Problem:** Data scraped or processed in one stage sometimes fails to be successfully `put` into the next queue, or is lost before being `get` by the next stage. This could be due to:
* Errors occurring *after* data is retrieved from an input queue but *before* it's successfully put into the output queue (e.g., during data transformation).
* The producer thread crashing or exiting prematurely without ensuring all processed data was enqueued.
_ Race conditions or logic errors in handling queue operations or worker thread lifecycles.
_ The consumer thread crashing after getting an item but before processing/passing it on.
**Solution:**

1.  Implement robust `try-except-finally` blocks around the entire process of getting data from an input queue, processing it, and putting it into the output queue. Ensure the `put` operation happens only on success.
2.  Use queue mechanisms like `queue.join()` and `queue.task_done()` appropriately if synchronization is needed to ensure all items are processed before shutdown.
3.  Implement proper error logging within each stage to pinpoint where failures occur.
4.  Consider transactional logic if possible (though often complex with queues) or implementing acknowledgment/retry mechanisms between stages.
5.  Ensure worker threads have graceful shutdown procedures that attempt to finish processing/enqueuing current items before exiting.

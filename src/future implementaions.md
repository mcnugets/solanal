## Error handling

[ ] implementing a more structured error handling messages: image like in apis

TODO: better error handling
message structure, add redis maybe, csv -> time series db, langchain, confusion matrix,

since latest llms are capable of reading the snapshots of the grapg, we gotta take advatange of that, by
either: rading it, adn then map the data or only read the graph, no top of that we dont have to extract indicators manually and rather let the snapshot take care of that.

## Tracking system thingy

[ ] implement tracking adn checkpoints thing in the program where we need to make sure if the current token has been added and if yes then skip.

Based on your project structure and the `Iscraper_thread_base` interface, here are strategic suggestions for incorporating inheritance/interface logic:

1. **Scraper Component Hierarchy**

- Create base interfaces for different scraper responsibilities:
  - `IDataValidator` for validation logic
  - `IDataProcessor` for data processing
  - `IQueueHandler` for queue operations
  - `IWebDriver` for selenium operations

2. **Threading Component Abstractions**

- Abstract common threading behaviors:
  - `IThreadManager` for thread lifecycle
  - `IResourceLock` for synchronization
  - `IBufferManager` for deque/queue handling
  - `IThreadState` for state management

3. **LLM Processing Chain**

- Create interfaces for LLM pipeline:
  - `IDataPreprocessor` for data preparation
  - `IModelInterface` for LLM interactions
  - `IResponseHandler` for output processing
  - `IPromptBuilder` for template management

4. **Data Model Inheritance**

- Create class hierarchy for data models:
  - Base token model
  - Base metrics model
  - Base holder model
  - Specialized implementations for each data source

5. **Error Handling Strategy**

- Create custom exception hierarchy:
  - Base scraper exception
  - Threading exceptions
  - Validation exceptions
  - LLM processing exceptions

6. **Configuration Management**

- Abstract configuration handling:
  - Base config loader
  - Environment-specific configs
  - Validation rules
  - Default configurations

7. **Resource Management**

- Create interfaces for:
  - File operations
  - Network requests
  - Database connections
  - Cache management

8. **Event System**

- Create event handling interfaces:
  - Event publisher
  - Event subscriber
  - Event dispatcher
  - Event types

9. **Logging Strategy**

- Abstract logging behavior:
  - Base logger interface
  - Specialized loggers for different components
  - Log formatters
  - Log handlers

10. **State Management**

- Create interfaces for:
  - Thread state
  - Process state
  - Data state
  - System state

11. **Create pydantic validations**

- for in between threads of each scraper vlidator
- validator for the configuration
- centralise web page object using pydantic models
- Create validation right before mapping a unprocesssed data

These abstractions would:

- Improve code organization
- Enable better testing
- Reduce code duplication
- Make the system more maintainable
- Allow easier extension of functionality
- Provide clear contracts between components

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these suggestions or show how to implement them in your specific codebase?

12. \*\*Manual/automatic review and auditing

- Create automations for reviewing incmoplete data
- Flag incomplete data as "need review"
- save to CSV for manual checks
- recover
- genereta summary of failed collected coins and successfully collected coins

12. **Detailed gmgn data scraping**
- We will need to implement a advanced scraped data mapping where we have optional labels as shown below adn we dynamically assign them based on: class, and their required position(index)
- ```

    optional_labels = {
        "Top 10": {
            "enabled": False,
            "selectors": ["css-mj0ydb", "css-1l8bjw7"]
        },
        "Dev holds": {
            "enabled": False,
            "selectors": ["css-1oxfeie", "css-1x9rvdf"]
        },
        "insiders": {
            "enabled": False,
            "selectors": ["css-kpoa7z", "css-13cuc7t"]
        },
        "snipers": {
            "enabled": False,
            "selectors": ["css-15hwqib", "css-1qsb47y"]
        },
        "rug": {
            "enabled": False,
            "selectors": ["css-15hwqib"]
        }
    }
```
